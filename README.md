# PANDA-LoginPage

Hey everyone, This is a beginner-friendly javascript project.Let us take a look at how this project works. This project consists of a panda illustration,
 
When the user focuses on the username input field, the panda moves its eye towards the input field. And when the user starts typing the password, the panda covers up his eyes with his hands. If we click outside the username field/password field, we make the panda go to its original state. We add smooth transitions to these movements.
